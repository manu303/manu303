# 👋 Hi there, I'm Manu!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I’m passionate about building impactful web applications, solving problems through code, and continuously growing as a developer.

## 🧭 Current Focus

### 🎯 JavaScript, DSA, and Backend Foundations

I’m currently focused on:

- Strengthening my programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills through Data Structures and Algorithms using JavaScript.
- Deeply learning JavaScript concepts to build a solid foundation for full-stack development.

### 🔧 Backend Development

Alongside DSA, I’m exploring:

- Core backend concepts including networking basics, databases, and operating systems.
- Backend development using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to build efficient and scalable server-side applications.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

### 🖥️ Full-Stack Web Development

I plan to integrate my learnings by:

- Developing strong frontend skills with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
- Exploring TypeScript to write more robust and scalable applications.
- Building full-stack projects that combine frontend and backend seamlessly.
- Practicing version control, collaboration, and real-world deployment workflows using Git and GitHub.

## ✨ Goal

My aim is to become a confident full-stack developer capable of building production-ready applications and contributing to impactful projects.
